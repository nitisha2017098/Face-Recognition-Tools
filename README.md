# Face-Recognition-Tools

### There are several free or open source and paid tools or software for Real-Time face recognition projects.

### Paid Tools:
+ Kairos : Kairos is a cloud-based face recognition tool that can be used for real-time video streams. It uses deep learning algorithms to analyze facial features and match them against a database of known faces.

+ Amazon Rekognition - Amazon Rekognition is a cloud-based image and video analysis service that can recognize faces, objects, and activities in real-time. It uses deep learning algorithms to analyze video streams and identify faces.

+ Microsoft Azure Face API - Microsoft Azure Face API is a cloud-based service that can detect and identify faces in real-time video streams. It uses deep learning algorithms to analyze facial features and match them against a database of known faces.

### Open-Source :

+ deepface : 

```
DeepFace is a facial recognition system developed by Facebook's AI research team, 
known as Facebook AI Research (FAIR). It uses deep learning algorithms to analyze 
and recognize faces in photos or videos. DeepFace works by first detecting and 
aligning faces in an image, and then mapping each face into a 3D space, where it 
is compared to a large database of labeled faces to identify the person.

DeepFace was introduced by Facebook in 2014 and achieved a 97.35% accuracy rate 
on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, which is a widely used benchmark 
for facial recognition systems. Since its introduction, DeepFace has been improved 
and has been used in a variety of applications, including Facebook's photo tagging 
system and security features.

Deepface is a lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis 
(age, gender, emotion and race) framework for python. It is a hybrid face 
recognition framework wrapping state-of-the-art models: VGG-Face, Google FaceNet, 
OpenFace, Facebook DeepFace, DeepID, ArcFace, Dlib and SFace.
